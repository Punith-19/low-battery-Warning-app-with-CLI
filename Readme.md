# Battery Alert Monitor

A simple Windows CLI application that monitors your battery level and alerts you when it drops below a specified threshold.

## Current Functionality

- **Battery Monitoring**: Continuously checks battery percentage in the background
- **Custom Threshold**: Set your preferred alert level (1-100%)
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface for control
- **Background Threading**: Monitoring runs in background while CLI remains responsive
- **Start/Stop Control**: Toggle monitoring on and off as needed
- **Status Display**: View current monitoring status and threshold

## 🔧 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd battery-alert-monitor
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**Create the virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

**Activate the virtual environment:**

On Windows Command Prompt:
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
```

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries

With the virtual environment activated, install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What gets installed:**
- `psutil` - For reading battery information

**Note:** `threading` is a built-in Python library and doesn't need installation.

**Alternative (manual installation):**
```bash
pip install psutil
```

## ▶️ How to Run

### Method 1: Using Batch File (Easiest)
Simply double-click `run.bat`

### Method 2: Using Command Prompt
1. Open Command Prompt in the project folder
2. Run:
```bash
python Main.py
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
battery-alert-monitor/
├── Main.py              # Entry point
├── Moniter_battery.py   # Battery monitoring logic
├── clip.py              # CLI interface
├── run.bat              # Batch file for easy execution
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── myenv/               # Virtual environment (not in git)
└── README.md            # This file
```

## How It Works

1. The program runs in the background using Python threading
2. Every 50 seconds, it checks your battery percentage
3. If battery is below threshold AND not plugged in, it displays a warning
4. The CLI remains responsive for you to control the monitoring

## Work in Progress

This is a personal-use application currently under development. Upcoming features:
- [ ] GUI alert popup (center-screen notification)
- [ ] Sound alerts
- [ ] Settings persistence (save threshold between sessions)
- [ ] System tray integration
- [ ] Auto-start with Windows
